Tips:

1. Refine your data story with your team

2. Review the selection of your initial strong data set to conduct all of your homework and term long project on. Although you cans witch to a better data set, it should be along the same story line.

3. Run linear regression on multiple features (one at a time) that you will be trying to predict .

4. conduct data preparation on your data

5. conduct data enrichment by adding one or more data sets to your base data set

6. find a latent manifold -- e.g., in the class example, Location and its features are the latent manifold

7. use the manifold to add features to your data set and run regression or clustering based on those new features. How does this improve the interpretability of your model? How does it add value to your business case?
